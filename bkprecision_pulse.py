#  in 'USB' mode.  To change this from the default 'GPIB':
#
#       Shift   (small blue button on the left)
#       Menu    (the I-set button, but shifted for a different function)
#       Select 'Communication' (use the arrow keys to move the blinker right)
#       Select 'USB' with the arrow keys and press 'Enter'
#       The 9130 should communicate over USB now!
